# My Custom Skill

Describe here what this skill is for, when to use it, and how it behaves so Copilot can apply it correctly in this project.


## Prerequisites

- Web application must be running and accessible (e.g., on localhost or a test environment)
- Playwright MCP server should be enabled in Agent mode
- Basic understanding of the application's user flows

## How to Use

When testing a web application, provide clear instructions about:

1. **The URL to test**: Specify the exact URL of your running application
2. **User flow steps**: List the sequence of actions to perform (e.g., "Click on 'NBA Scores'", "Verify game scores are displayed")
3. ** Create the test file**: Place the test file alongside  in the same folder of action, named <filename>.test.js
3. **Expected outcomes**: What should be visible or happen at each step
4. **Screenshot requirements**: Which pages or states to capture visually
